# Command-Line-ToDo
A small project made for use in CPSC 501 for assignment 1. A simple todo list application that runs on command line.

The purpose of the assignment is to take old code you have written and improve it with a series of refactors:
- 3 simple refactors (including but not limited to renaming, moving repeatable code to a function, moving code between sub and super classes, etc)
- 2 major refactors (mostly focused around cleaning up and improving an algorithm or section of program logic in code)

Unfortunately I did not have any old code of sufficient complexity, so instead I am creating a quick and dirty project with some intentionally
bad design and practices to try and emulate my coding style and ability as a beginner. 

**This project should not be used to judge my programming ability.**
